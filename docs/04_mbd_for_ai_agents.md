# 04: Milestone-Based Development (MBD) for CRC Carpooling Service

## 1. Introduction

Milestone-Based Development (MBD) structures the development process around a series of significant achievements or decision points. This approach is well-suited for the CRC Carpooling Service project, providing a clear roadmap and enabling effective progress tracking.

This document provides a guide to using MBD for the CRC Carpooling Service project, based on the requirements and architecture outlined in the [02_prd_for_ai_projects.md](02_prd_for_ai_projects.md) and [03_tad_for_ai_systems.md](03_tad_for_ai_systems.md).

## 2. The MBD Process for CRC Carpooling Service

The MBD process for the CRC Carpooling Service will consist of the following steps:

1.  **Define the milestones:** Milestones will be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
2.  **Create a milestone plan:** Outline tasks, dependencies, and responsible parties for each milestone.
3.  **Track progress:** Regularly monitor progress against the plan, identifying and addressing potential issues early.
4.  **Review and adjust:** Periodically review and adjust the milestone plan to ensure its continued relevance and achievability.

## 3. Key Concepts in MBD for CRC Carpooling Service

### 3.1. Context-Constrained Execution

For AI agents assisting in this project, context-constrained execution means providing only the necessary information for the current task, reducing complexity and focusing efforts.

### 3.2. Verifiable Milestones

Each milestone will be defined with clear, objectively verifiable criteria to ensure accurate progress assessment and project alignment.

## 4. Benefits of MBD for CRC Carpooling Service

MBD offers several benefits for the CRC Carpooling Service development:

*   **Reduced risk:** Early identification of issues and proactive corrective actions.
*   **Increased transparency:** Clear visibility into project status for all stakeholders.
*   **Improved communication:** Enhanced collaboration between the development team and church leadership.
*   **Greater flexibility:** Adaptability to evolving requirements and feedback.
