# 06: Project Categorization Strategy (PCS) for CRC Carpooling Service

## 1. Introduction

A Project Categorization Strategy (PCS) provides a framework for classifying projects based on their characteristics, aiding in planning, resource allocation, and risk management. This document outlines the PCS for the CRC Carpooling Service project.

This document adapts the PCS for AI projects, based on the principles outlined in the previous documents in this framework.

## 2. PCS for CRC Carpooling Service

The CRC Carpooling Service project can be categorized in several ways:

*   **By AI Technique:**
    *   **Initial Phase:** Primarily a web application development project with no direct AI/ML components. Focus is on core functionality, data management, and real-time communication.
    *   **Future Phases (Potential AI Integration):** Could involve Machine Learning (ML) for ride matching optimization, Natural Language Processing (NLP) for advanced chat features (e.g., sentiment analysis, automated responses), or predictive analytics for demand forecasting.

*   **By Application Area:**
    *   **Community/Social Service:** Facilitates interaction and support within a specific community (church members).
    *   **Transportation/Logistics:** Focuses on coordinating rides and managing transportation for events.
    *   **Event Management Support:** Integrates with event scheduling and attendance.

*   **By Project Lifecycle Stage:**
    *   **Current Stage:** Development & Integration (building the core application and integrating various components).
    *   **Future Stages:** Deployment & Operations (post-launch support, monitoring, and maintenance), and potentially Research & Development for new AI features.

*   **By Technical Requirements and Challenges:**
    *   **Data & Data Quality:** Requires high-quality data for user profiles, event details, and ride information. Challenges include ensuring data accuracy and privacy.
    *   **Model & Algorithms:** (Initial phase: Rule-based matching logic. Future: ML models for optimization).
    *   **Integration & Operations (MLOps):** Requires robust CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and scalable infrastructure for real-time features. Challenges include managing real-time data flow and ensuring high availability.
    *   **Security & Ethics:** High importance on user data privacy, secure communication, and ethical considerations in ride matching and user interactions.

## 3. How to Use the PCS

The PCS for the CRC Carpooling Service will be used to:

*   **Allocate resources:** Guide the allocation of development, testing, and operational resources based on the current project phase and technical needs.
*   **Manage risk:** Identify and mitigate risks associated with specific project categories (e.g., data privacy risks for community applications, scalability risks for real-time systems).
*   **Communicate with stakeholders:** Provide a clear understanding of the project's nature, its current focus, and future potential to church leadership, IT administrators, and members.
