# 01: Introduction to the CRC Carpooling Service Project

## 1. The CRC Carpooling Service

The CRC Carpooling Service is a new initiative to facilitate carpooling among church members for various church events. This service aims to provide a convenient, safe, and community-driven solution for transportation, fostering stronger connections within the church.

## 2. Purpose of This Project

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive web application that enables:

*   **Members to offer and request rides:** For church services, events, and prayer sessions.
*   **Flexible payment options:** Drivers can choose to offer rides for free or charge a fee.
*   **Real-time communication:** Facilitate seamless communication between drivers and passengers.
*   **Admin oversight:** An IT person at the church will manage events and user access.
*   **Pastor approval:** Pastors will onboard and approve members to ensure community integrity.
*   **Mapping and notifications:** Integrate maps for route visualization and real-time notifications for trip updates.

## 3. The Agentic SDLC Framework in this Project

This project will leverage the Agentic SDLC Framework to ensure a structured, efficient, and ethical development process. AI agents will play a role in various aspects of development, from code generation to documentation and testing.

This framework consists of the following interconnected documents, which will guide the project from conception to deployment:

*   **[00_custom_instructions.md](00_custom_instructions.md):** Custom instructions for AI agents involved in this project.
*   **[02_prd_for_ai_projects.md](02_prd_for_ai_projects.md):** Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the CRC Carpooling Service.
*   **[03_tad_for_ai_systems.md](03_tad_for_ai_systems.md):** Technical Architecture Document (TAD) for the CRC Carpooling Service.
*   **[04_mbd_for_ai_agents.md](04_mbd_for_ai_agents.md):** Milestone-Based Development (MBD) for the CRC Carpooling Service project.
*   **[05_aep_for_llms.md](05_aep_for_llms.md):** Agent Execution Policy (AEP) for Large Language Models (LLMs) involved in this project.
*   **[06_pcs_for_ai_projects.md](06_pcs_for_ai_projects.md):** Project Categorization Strategy (PCS) for the CRC Carpooling Service.
*   **[07_persistent_memory_for_ai_agents.md](07_persistent_memory_for_ai_agents.md):** Persistent Memory for AI agents in this project.

## 4. How to Use This Documentation

We recommend reading the documents in the order they are presented to understand the logical progression of the project development. This framework is designed to be adaptable to the specific needs of the CRC Carpooling Service.
